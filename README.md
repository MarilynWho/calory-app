## USER STORY

As a health-conscious individual who wants to make more informed decisions about the food I eat, I want an app that can help me easily track the calorie content of my meals and ingredients. This way, I can make healthier food choices, discover healthier alternatives, and achieve my wellness goals. With this app, I'll be able to monitor my calorie intake, ultimately leading  a healthier lifestyle and making better decisions about the food I eat, every day.

## Usage

This webpage is designed to allow the user to select a variety of cuisines such as Korean, Chinese, Japanese, etc. even to western cuisine such as American, Latin American and even European cuisines. When a user selects a cuisine, the app will show them a variety of choices shown in cards with images. Then, when the user clicks on the button to show the recipe instruction with health score to show how healthy the recipe is ranging towards 100%.

Once the user knows what recipe they want, they also have the option to search for any ingredients and know how healthy it is. The said ingredient searched will be saved to the localstorage and will show as autocomplete under the search bar, meaning they have searched for that ingredient before.
